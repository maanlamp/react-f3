# React F3

Some simple components, hooks & utilities for creating and managing forms in React.

## Why?

Creating forms should be simple. React code should be idiomatic. Code should be type-safe.

Somehow, all the biggest form libraries for React do not tick all these boxes. They either:

- Jump through crazy hoops to prevent React form doing state management, which it's made for.
- Sacrifice usability for type-safety.
- Aren't type-safe at all.

React-f3 promises to take a step back, rethink what a form actually is (and importantly, what it **_is not_**), and makes developing these forms a delightful yet robust experience.

## What does F3 stand for?

It stands for `form, form, form`, of course! This is because, when using this package, your forms will often start with the following:

```tsx
<Form form={form}>
```
