# React F3

Some components, hooks & utilities for creating and managing forms in React, with validation through Zod.

## Why?

Forms should be simple. React code should be idiomatic. Code should be type-safe.

For some reason, all of the most used form libraries for React either:

- Are very complicated just to be type-safe
- Create their own state management solution instead of leveraging React for what it was made for
- Aren't type-safe to begin with

React-f3 promises to take a step back, rethink what a form actually is (and importantly, what it **_is not_**), and makes developing these forms a delightful yet robust experience.

## What does F3 stand for?

It stands for `form, form, form`, of course! This is because, when using this package, your forms will often start with the following:

```tsx
<Form form={form}>
```
